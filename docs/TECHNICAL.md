# Technical Direction

## Current decisions

- **Renderer:** Three.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Build tool and development server:** Vite
- **3D asset creation:** Blender
- **Editable 3D masters:** `.blend`
- **Primary runtime 3D asset format:** `.glb` (binary glTF)
- **Version control:** Git and GitHub
- **Deployment:** static browser build
- **Target public path:** `/zealot-of-harperhay/`
- **Initial hosting:** GitHub Pages, through the existing website
- **Possible later asset hosting:** Cloudflare R2, if asset volume or delivery requirements justify it
- **Initial platform:** desktop browser MVP
- **Architecture:** lightweight, with no unnecessary frameworks

Development-only references, source photography, `.blend` masters, and renders live outside `public/` so Vite does not copy them into the production build. Only runtime-ready files belong in `public/assets/`.

## Naming conventions

### TypeScript and source files

- Use `camelCase.ts` for modules and utilities, for example `cameraController.ts`.
- Use `PascalCase.ts` only for modules whose primary export is a class or component with the same name.
- Use descriptive English names; avoid unexplained abbreviations.
- Name tests after the source module, using `.test.ts` when tests are introduced.
- Keep directories lowercase and organise them by game domain rather than technical file type.

### Assets

- Use lowercase `kebab-case` filenames, for example `harperhay-bus-stop.glb`.
- Use ASCII letters, numbers, and hyphens only; do not use spaces.
- Add a meaningful variant suffix where needed, for example `brick-wall-wet-albedo.jpg`.
- Use conventional texture suffixes: `-albedo`, `-normal`, `-roughness`, `-metalness`, `-emissive`, and `-ao`.
- Include resolution only when multiple runtime resolutions exist, for example `shop-sign-albedo-1k.jpg`.
- Keep names stable after an asset is referenced by code.
- Mirror a runtime asset's base name in its Blender master where practical.
